Which ECMASCript proposal are you most excited about, and why?

- import
It allows to dynamicaly load a module at runtime. This is good to call parts of javascrip only when is needed instead of get all the code at the pre-runtime.

- finally
A callback will be invoked when a promisse is settled. It helps to take action wheather the result is success or fail.

- Object.fromEntries
It helps to get objects from a key paired values in an array.

- Private Class fields
Can help the devs hides some details of implementation. However the way it's being proposed still concerns me. Insead of using a reserved word (i.e prived or protected) the proposal suggest to use a hash (#) symbol.
