# Question

If you were responsible for architecting / building a large, data-management web application (lots of C.R.U.D. of data objects), what stack (and framework(s)) would you select and why? Assume there will be a dozen developers working on it, and its expected lifespan is a decade.

# Answer

Although the answer depends on a more detailed explanation about the kind of project, I would suggest the following 2 options of stack.

# Javascript: 
- Node.Js as server side. Why? It's cross-plataform, It has a long term support and great support from community. It is a good fit for api/microservices.
- React as front-end. Why? It's largely used and so have great support from community. It's fast, easy to learn and fast development.
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB - This topic certainly depends on more specification but this would be my two options wheather the database needs to be relational or note and in both cases there are options of it on cloud. I would go with PostgreSQL on a relational case because of its scalability, 

- Cloud: Aws, Azure

# .Net
- .net core as server side. Why? It's a great framework that now is open source. Has support from a great company and a big comunity. It is stable, scalable and cross-plataform.
- React as front-end. Why? The same reasons mentioned before.
- SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDb - Also, it will depend on many factors but I'd go with one of these three options.
- Cloud: Aws, Azure
