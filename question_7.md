# Question

If you were responsible for architecting / building a large, data-management web application (lots of C.R.U.D. of data objects), what stack (and framework(s)) would you select and why? Assume there will be a dozen developers working on it, and its expected lifespan is a decade.

- GIT as Source Control
Why? Reliable with good documentation and big community.

- Node.Js as Server Side
Why? 

- React as Front-End framework
Why?
